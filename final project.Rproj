Plot of standardized residuals - here we see a systematic increase in the variance of the Eij as the level of the response increases (the residuals on the right-had side of the plot have a greater vertical spread than those on the left, forming a wedge-shaped pattern) 

```{r}

```

```{r}
means<- aggregate(raw.counts[,6], by = list(raw.counts[,2]), FUN = mean)
head(means)
```

```{r}
